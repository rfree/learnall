====== ssh ======
Created Tuesday 30 June 2015


Get users in group "filetransfer" to be forced to only ssh into ftp (to only use scp), 
instead of allowing them to get the full ssh shell for commands:


Subsystem sftp internal-sftp
Match group filetransfer
	ChrootDirectory %h
	X11Forwarding no
	AllowTcpForwarding no
	ForceCommand internal-sftp
