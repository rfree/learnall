Download keys.

For each key (e.g. of Mempo) that you downloaded, there are two questions:
* Validity - do you think that they key eg 4623E8F745953F23 actually belongs to "Mempo (the secure OS)"
* Trust - would you trust this guy to tell you which other keys are valid, e.g. that 38DBBDC86092693E is Linux Stable

This gives you options, you should edit the key  gpg --edit-key 4623E8F745953F23 and then do a command:
* sign - to say that this key is Valid, you will sign it to remember you consider it valid. 
* lsign - the same, but this note if your private (l for local) and you will never tell the world about that
* trust - to set the trust and start using this key owner's judgement about validity of other keys

<K_F> maybe except for the cert digest algo that will break backwards compat
<K_F> and keep in mind that outside the context of rfc6337 sha1 and 3des are tacitly appended anyways
