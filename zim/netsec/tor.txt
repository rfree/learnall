**TODO: move this all to mempo documentation?**

As root, configure this and restart tor.
In file [[/etc/tor/torrc]] find line with "SockPort" (or add it) and add there following options so it will read as:

SocksPort 9050 IsolateClientAddr IsolateSOCKSAuth IsolateClientProtocol  IsolateDestPort IsolateDestAddr

This is very important, otherwise same Tor circuit is re-used for different accesses, making it much easier to correlate your various activities!
TEST: To test if that works, open few "what is my IP" pages and verify if they show different IP each usually
